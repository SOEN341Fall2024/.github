## 📜 **Project Description**
The **Peer Assessment System** is designed for university team projects, enabling students to evaluate their teammates across four critical dimensions:  
1. 🤝 **Cooperation**  
2. 🧠 **Conceptual Contribution**  
3. 🛠️ **Practical Contribution**  
4. 💼 **Work Ethic**  

Our development follows the **Agile methodology**, with incremental deliveries across four sprints. By project completion, we aim to present a **middle-fidelity prototype** that serves as the foundation for a fully functional product.
